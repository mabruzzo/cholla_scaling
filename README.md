A simple program to assist with cholla scaling tests.

I recommend installing as editable installation (since some corners have been cut). From the root directory, invoke:

```shell
$ python -m pip install -e .
```

Then you can invoke the program with:

```shell
$ python -m cholla_scaling <args>
```

where ``<args>`` should be replaced with cli args (e.g. ``--help``)
